# express-graphql-postgres-starter

Basic boilerplate for a GraphQL API that uses Express, PostgreSQL, Sequelize, and Apollo.

Includes authentication using JWT and resolver middleware for permission/role based authorization.

The boilerplate app includes only a User model for authentication purposes.

Uses winston for logging.

Uses jest for testing.

Uses eslint and airbnb's style guide for linting.

There is a lot of room for improvement.
